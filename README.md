wm-bookmarklets
===============

Bookmarklets for hopping between wm environments

Create a bookmark in your browser (probably your bookmarks bar is best)

Copy and paste the contents of each one here to the location.

It will auto-detect if you're on mobile, local, stag, prod or prod origin and redirect you to the same page in the environment that the bookmarklet is named for. i.e. - if you want to see this local mobile page in stag, click on the "To Stag" bookmarklet, and you'll go to stag mobile.
